### **_Description_**

#### MyShelf is a PERN fullstack application that allows for authenticated users to keep track of books they have previously read, while rating and reviewing them for their personal use. MyShelf solves the problem of helping readers to keep track of their "to be read" list while helping you remember what books have completed that you liked and what you didn't like. The application allows for you to add books to a TBR (to be read) list and then once you complete a book, you can write a personal note (the book report) about the book, as well as rate it and decide whether you'd read it again. This will help you to remember what you did and didn't like about the book and whether it's a book you'd want to reread in the future! Essentially, this is a lot like a 'reading diary' that helps a user keep track of the books they've read and determine whether they are worth reading again.
